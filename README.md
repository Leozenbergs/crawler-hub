## Available Scripts

  

In the project directory, you can run:

  

### `yarn start`

  

Runs the app in the development mode.<br /> Open

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

  

The page will reload if you make edits.<br /> You will also see any lint errors

in the console.

  

### `yarn test`

  

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br /> See the section

about

[running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)

for more information.

  

### `yarn build`

  

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br /> It correctly bundles

React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

  

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br /> Your app is

ready to be deployed!

  

See the section about

[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for

more information.

  

### `yarn eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

  

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can

`eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from

your project.

  

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive

dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have

full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but

they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point

you’re on your own.

  

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for

small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this

feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t

customize it when you are ready for it.

  

## Docker-compose

  

In case you have the docker and docker-compose installed on your machine you can also run and build the application by just running `docker-compose build` and `docker-compose up`
